# Odin-CSS-Website
This is a webpage I am working on for the Odin Project at the end of the CSS segment.

In this project I have attempted to use the skills I have learned, foremost of those:

- creating containers, classes, and ids in HTML
- formatting those containers via flexbox (display: flex and flex-direction: column/row)
- adjusting the positioning via margins and padding
